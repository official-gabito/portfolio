Objective:
Enhance my existing React portfolio by fixing some design bugs, adding two new sections (Testimonials & FAQ), and implementing an animated loading screen.

🔧 Enhancements Needed
1. ✅ Fix the Book Appointment Section
Inputs (name, email, date, time, etc.) are blending into the background — fix contrast so labels and placeholders are fully visible.

Placeholders are not showing — make sure each input has a visible placeholder.

Labels are hiding behind the input fields — fix label positioning and z-index.

Header text for the section is hard to read — improve typography contrast.

Entire section should be clearly readable in both light and dark modes.

2. ✅ Fix Input Fields Globally
Across the whole portfolio, make sure:

Input labels are visible and positioned properly

Input placeholders are not hidden

All text is legible in both light and dark themes (especially Contact and Appointment sections)

3. ✅ Replace and Enhance Resume Download Section
Change "Download CV" text to "Download Resume"

Improve the section's layout — currently it seems broken or partially hidden

Make sure the resume button is fully visible, well-placed, and styled properly

Ensure it works correctly: downloads the file when clicked

4. ✅ Add a Testimonials Section
Title: "Testimonials"

Show 3–5 client reviews in a carousel or card layout

Each testimonial includes:

Client name

Optional photo or initials-based avatar

Star rating

Review text

Animate the cards on scroll or auto-slide

Make it responsive and polished

5. ✅ Add FAQ Section (Frequently Asked Questions)
Title: "Frequently Asked Questions"

Use accordion-style toggle UI

Sample questions:

“What technologies do you use?” → “React, Flutter, Firebase...”

“Do you offer post-project support?” → “Yes, maintenance is available.”

“How long does a project take?” → “2–6 weeks depending on complexity.”

When a user clicks a question, the answer should smoothly expand

Fully mobile responsive

Nice animation on toggle open/close

6. ✅ Add a Custom Animated Loader
While the site is loading, show an animated loading screen

Should feel smooth, elegant, and professional

Animation idea:

Animated initials (GN), or

Spinning developer icons, or

Morphing shape animation with progress indicator

Hide the loader once the portfolio has fully rendered

📌 Notes
This is for enhancing an existing React portfolio

Do not rebuild from scratch — just apply these changes and additions

Focus on clean UI, text visibility, modern animations, and a good mobile experience
